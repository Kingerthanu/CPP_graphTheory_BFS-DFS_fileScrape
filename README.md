# CPP_graphTheory_BFS-DFS_fileScrape
  Program scrapes a txt document for a edge-matrix / incidence matrix. It will put all this data together and connect the parts. It will then go through from a given origin throughout the graph represented through a adjacency matrix until its reached all positions. It will prioritize a smaller number / Letter compared to a larger one.

  Program was fun and allowed for input santization of command-line arguments which I have't really messed too much with usually using cin for inputs.
