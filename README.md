# CPP_graphTheory_BFS-DFS_fileScrape
  Program scrapes a txt document for a edge-matrix / incidence matrix. It will put all this data together and connect the parts. It will then go through from a given origin throughout the graph represented through a adjacency matrix until its reached all positions. It will prioritize a smaller number / Letter compared to a larger one.

  Program was fun and allowed for input santization of command-line arguments which I have't really messed too much with usually using cin for inputs.

**The Breakdown:**

This C++ Program Will Use The Terminal In Order To Show BFS And DFS Traversal On A Adjacency List Passed By The User.

 This Program Grabs A FilePath Defining A File In Which Contains A Adjacency List For A Linked Graph By The User As Well As A Origin Position.

 This Data Will Be Passed Into A Graph Class In Which Will Load In The Data From The FileName Provided, Store It In A Bool** Adjacency List Member And Use This To Call Internal Functions To DFS As Well AS BFS.

 While Not That Crazy On Structure, The Application Of BFS And DFS Wasn't Too Bad Understand The Proper Traversal Method For These Adjacency Lists But The Program Overall Helped Me Learn A Lot More About Proper Encapsulative Programming As Loading In From A File And Commiting This Data To Internal Private Methods Was Interesting To Do. It Also Shows A Lot Of Power These Traversal Methods Can Have When Properly Considered For In Our Data Structure(s) Designs In Which Use Them.
